OctoAcme runs a structured, iterative project management approach that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement. Projects begin with a lightweight initiation (a one‑pager that captures the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline) and a decision gate that requires clear success metrics and stakeholder alignment before planning. Planning breaks approved work into shippable backlog items using a standard template (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, owner) and produces a release plan and Definition of Done; dependencies and risks are recorded in a simple Risk Register for ongoing monitoring.

Workflows emphasize small, testable increments and a clear project board flow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done). The PR workflow encourages small pull requests (target ≤ 400 lines), linking PRs to issues and acceptance criteria, and running CI (tests, linting, security scans) before requesting reviews. Planning and execution include timeboxed sprint/iteration planning, capacity-aware pull planning, and a release checklist that covers staging smoke tests, rollback plans, and post‑deploy verification.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined: Product Managers own the product vision and success metrics, Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications, Developers implement and test features, QA validates acceptance criteria, and Stakeholders provide input and approvals. Communication cadence is regimented — daily standups for the delivery team, weekly delivery syncs and PM/PdM alignments, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad‑hoc escalations — supported by templates (weekly status, incident comms) and a single source of truth in project READMEs or release docs.

Quality assurance and risk controls are embedded into the lifecycle: unit and integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, manual QA when needed, and security scanning in CI. Progress and health are tracked with velocity and burndown metrics and dashboards for key signals (errors, latency, usage). After sprints, releases, or incidents, retrospectives capture what went well, improvements, and owner‑assigned action items which are tracked in the backlog to ensure continuous improvement.
